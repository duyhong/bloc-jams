# Bloc Jams

![Node Install](../master/screenshots/album.png)

Bloc Jams is a digital music player like [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/). This is an application built on Javascript and jQuery.

## Pull Down the Code

Start by cloning the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/duyhong/bloc-jams.git <your-project-name>
```

## Reset Git

This will be your personal application. So all of the past commit history that I used to build this  app aren't needed. Also you will want to be able to push/pull code from your personal remote (Github) repository and NOT my remote (Github) repository.

Remove the existing local Git repository:

```
$ rm -r -f .git
```


## Run the Application

Go into the folder where the application was cloned. Open the file `index.html` with your browser.

For example, right click on file `index.html`, click on `open with`, and select Google Chrome.
